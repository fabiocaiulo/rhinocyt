# Development of a platform for cytology image analysis with the support of artificial intelligence

## Abstract

Rhinology studies the anatomy, physiology, and disorders that affect the nasal region: one of the most modern techniques for diagnose these types of affections is nasal cytology (sometimes also called rhinocytology). It involves the analysis under a microscope of the cells contained in the nasal mucosa.

This thesis work contributes to the realization of a system software for diagnostic support to the rhinocytology specialist, automating the process from the extraction of elements cells up to their classification and counting. In based on the numerosity of cell classes and the results history of the patient and his family members, the system proposes to the specialist some possible pathologies on the basis of algorithms known diagnostics.

Specifically, the work is focused on the design and implementation of a web platform for the classification of images of cells. In this activity, which begins at the end of the image extraction and provides the input for the diagnostic phase, speed and accuracy are of fundamental importance in the classification. Such features are ensured by the use of machine learning techniques such as neural networks.

Although one of the main issues related to machine learning in the medical field is related to the unbalanced dataset, progressively the system will be able to 
capable of recognizing and labeling up to eight different cell types. The encouraging results can be improved in the future by adopting a more precise and accurate classifier, so as to enhance its performance in the presence of particularly rare cell types.
